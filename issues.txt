I'm gonna need to start using Github issues

Issues with Darfey

- Clicking Blog link when in a post (posts/3) links to posts/blog instead of posts
- Actually all links link to post/*
FIXED

- Media page
    - Images/Videos need to take 255 space always
    - Add padding to the side
FIXED

- Image modal viewer: scale to fit screen
DONE

- Blog: Remove listing the text body in the SQL table
DONE

- Blog: Test by adding a few copy-paste posts

- Blog: Add timestamp

- Blog: Add author

- Add Users (authors)
    - Add user support for creating/editing a blog post
    - Only one user for now (us)
Not needed yet. We can just remove posting for now and manually add them to the SQL tables using psql. Add a command-line updater later that reads a html page and adds it to the blog.
Actually we can do this all without users if we restrict the updates to localhost for now.

- Media: Add an SQL table for these so we can add captions and so on
    - could just use Instagram instead?

- Media: fix the thumbs not matching
    - need to do name matching instead of using two lists so we don't
    accidentially use wrong thumbs
DONE

- Media: Find images instead of thumbs
    - find thumb based on image name
    - Log images without thumbs (and display them in full size)
DONE

- Home: Remove (not needed)
DONE

- Tests: Add SQL database initialisation and destruction

- Add copyright notice in the footer

- SQL: add Ecto modules instead of raw queries

- Modals: Disable scrolling when modal window is shown
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4770025/how-to-disable-scrolling-temporarily
    - the CSS version by adding stop-scrolling to div/body

- Modals: Arrow keys to move to next/prev image
    - this doesn't really make sense or work for videos since scrolling the video would be a better idea.

- Modals: When the browser is very wide and short scales the image to fit width messing the aspect ratio.

Code Snippet
    # Interesting snippet for comparing lists
    path = "assets/static/images/media/"
    thumbs = Path.wildcard(path <> "*_thumb*")
    all = Path.wildcard(path <> "*")
    originals = MapSet.difference(Enum.into(all, MapSet.new), Enum.into(thumbs, MapSet.new)) |> MapSet.to_list
